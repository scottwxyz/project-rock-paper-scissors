It’s best practice to link to an external JavaScript file inside this script tag. 
Using an external JavaScript file keeps your HTML file clean and organized.

You don’t have to write additional code in the HTML file. 
This game is played entirely via the console.
    
STEPS
- write the logic to get the computer choice
--- create a getComputerChoice function
--- have it randomly return 1 of 3 strtings: rock, paper, scissors
    hints: Math.random method and you don't need arrays
--- test that it works in the console before moving on

- write the logic to get the human choice
--- create a getHumanChoice function
--- have it return one of the choices depending on what the user inputs
    hint: use the prompt method to get the input
--- test that it works in the console before moving on


- declare the players score variables
--- create variables for humanScore and computerScore in global scope
--- initialize both scores as 0

- write the logic to play a single round
--- create a playRound function
--- define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice
--- use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments
--- make your function’s humanChoice parameter case-insensitive so that 
    players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
--- Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value 
    representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
--- Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.

Example code:

    function playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice) {
    // your code here!
    }

    const humanSelection = getHumanChoice();
    const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();

    playRound(humanSelection, computerSelection);


- write the logic to play the entire game
--- Create a new function named playGame.
--- Move your playRound function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new playGame function
--- Play 5 rounds by calling playRound 5 times.
    Hint: When you assign a function call to a variable, the return value of that function is assigned to the variable. 
    Accessing the variable afterward will only provide the assigned value; it doesn’t recall the function. 
    You need to recall the choice functions to get new choices for each round.
--- Re-work your previous functions or create more helper functions if necessary. Specifically, you may want to change the return values to something more useful.
--- If you already know about loops, you can use them. If not, don’t worry! Loops will be covered in the next lesson.
